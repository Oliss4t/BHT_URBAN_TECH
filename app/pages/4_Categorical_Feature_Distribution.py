A problem with the beeswarm plot is, that it uses common norm over all categorical values. If one category outnumbers the others, only the distribution of the majority category is visible.
All other categories are only visible as a line, even if that is not the case.
That is why i decided to plot a density diagram without a common norm. Thereby the distribution for each category gets visible.
