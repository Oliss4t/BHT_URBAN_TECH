A problem with the beeswarm plot is, that i uses common norm over all categorical values. If one category outnumbers the others, only the distribution of the majority category is visible.
All other categories are only visible as a line, even if that is not the case.
That is why i decided to plot a density diagram without a common norm. Thereby the distribution for each category gets visible.
